# Beat the Runner

Beat the Runner is a full-screen, kid-friendly browser game where players race a cartoon runner to finish their real-world task. Set a race duration, enjoy a playful 3-2-1 countdown, and tap the huge **I am DONE** button to win before the runner reaches the finish line. A win triggers a 10-second celebration with confetti, balloons, and sparkles before revealing the replay screen with share options. Responsive layouts, accessible controls, and motion-aware visuals keep the experience joyful on phones, tablets, and desktops.
